## Description

 Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, Caesar's code , is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques.
 It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
 For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

   * A good example would be one like this, it shifts letters by reverse shift of 3 letters

           Input String: THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG
           Encrypted String: QEB NRFZH YOLTK CLU GRJMP LSBO QEB IXWV ALD
           Decrypted String: THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG


   * Deciphering is done  with a right shift of 3letters.
